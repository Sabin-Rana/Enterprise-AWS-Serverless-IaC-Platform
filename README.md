## Architecture Overview

### API Gateway and Lambda Module

REST API with regional endpoints for low-latency performance. Lambda functions with configuration including memory optimization, timeout settings, and environment variables.

**API Endpoints:**
- GET /posts - Blog posts retrieval with pagination
- POST /posts - Blog post creation (Cognito protected)
- GET /projects - Portfolio projects listing
- Authentication endpoints with JWT token management

### DynamoDB Database Module

NoSQL tables with provisioned capacity and auto-scaling readiness. Global Secondary Indexes for flexible query patterns. Point-in-time recovery enabled for data protection with server-side encryption.

**Table Design:**
- PostsTable - Blog content with title, content, metadata
- ProjectsTable - Portfolio projects with skills, links, descriptions
- Optimized key design for efficient query patterns

### Cognito Authentication Module

User Pools with MFA configuration and advanced security features. Identity Pools for AWS resource access with fine-grained IAM policies. OAuth 2.0 flows with proper callback URL management.

**Authentication Flow:**
```
User → React App → Cognito Hosted UI → JWT Token → API Gateway Authorizer → Lambda
```

### S3 and CloudFront Storage Module

Static website hosting with versioning and lifecycle policies. Global CDN distribution with Origin Access Control for security. SSL certificate configuration with custom domain support.

**Frontend Delivery:**
```
React SPA → S3 Origin → CloudFront Edge Locations → Global Users
```

### CloudWatch Monitoring Module

Centralized dashboards for API performance, Lambda metrics, and cost monitoring. Metric alarms for error rates, latency thresholds, and resource utilization. X-Ray tracing for distributed system monitoring.

**Monitoring Coverage:**
- Lambda execution duration and error rates
- API Gateway latency and throttling
- DynamoDB read/write capacity
- Application performance insights

### AWS Config Compliance Module

Continuous compliance monitoring with 10+ security rules. Config Recorder for resource configuration tracking. Security Hub integration for centralized findings management.

**Compliance Rules:**
- lambda-function-public-access-prohibited
- dynamodb-pitr-enabled
- api-gw-execution-logging-enabled
- cloudwatch-alarm-config-rule
- s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited

### Drift Detection Module

Real-time infrastructure change monitoring with CloudWatch Events. Scheduled Terraform plans for configuration drift detection. Custom Lambda functions for analysis and SNS notifications for alerts.

**Detection Strategy:**
- Weekly Terraform plan comparisons
- Real-time CloudWatch event monitoring
- Automated alerting for configuration changes
- Custom drift analysis logic

---

## Safety Implementation

### CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

**Active Workflows (Safe Validation):**
- Terraform Validation: Syntax checking, configuration validation, planning only
- Security Scanning: Code quality, vulnerability assessment with continue-on-error
- Frontend Build: React application compilation and testing
- Drift Detection: Configuration monitoring and change detection

**Disabled Workflows (Safety Measure):**
- Serverless Deployment: Lambda function deployment
- Frontend Deployment: S3 sync and CloudFront invalidation
- Terraform Apply: AWS resource creation

### Zero-Cost Validation Approach

**Count Parameter Safety:**

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_function" "api" {
  # ============================================================================
  # ZERO-COST VALIDATION - DEPLOYMENT CONTROL
  # ============================================================================
  # CURRENT: count = 0 (Validation Mode)
  #   - Shows in terraform plan as "will not be created"
  #   - Demonstrates complete configuration
  #   - Maintains $0 AWS costs
  #
  # FOR DEPLOYMENT: Change to count = 1
  #   - Creates actual AWS resource
  #   - Incurs standard service pricing
  # ============================================================================
  count = 0
  
  function_name = "${var.project_name}-api"
  # ... full configuration
}
```

**Validation Benefits:**

- 30 AWS resources visible in Terraform plan output
- Professional documentation with plan evidence
- GitHub Actions validation without costs
- Architecture design and planning without financial risk
- Deployment ready - simple count change activates

**Deployment Readiness Verification:**

To prove this infrastructure is deployment-ready and not just theoretical, I tested with count set to 1:

- Changed count parameter from 0 to 1 across all resources
- Ran `terraform plan` showing all 30 resources ready for creation
- Captured screenshots as evidence of deployment readiness
- Reverted back to count = 0 for safe validation mode

The repository includes both configurations:
- `main.tf` - Current validation mode (count = 0)
- `main.tf.with-count-1` - Deployment-ready configuration with screenshots

This demonstrates the architecture is tested and verified, ready to deploy with a simple count parameter change.

### Validation Scripts Suite

5 Safety and Automation Scripts:

- `cost-validator.sh` - Comprehensive cost auditing and free-tier validation
- `safety-check.sh` - Pre-validation safety checks and environment verification
- `analyzer.sh` - Terraform plan analysis and resource counting
- `validation-manager.sh` - Validation environment management
