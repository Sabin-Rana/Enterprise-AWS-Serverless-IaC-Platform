# GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW - SECURITY SCANNING
# ==============================================================================
# This workflow implements enterprise security patterns including:
# - SAST: Static Application Security Testing
# - Infrastructure Security: Terraform security scanning
# - Dependency Scanning: Vulnerability detection in dependencies
# - Secret Detection: Prevention of credential exposure
# - Zero-Cost Safety: No deployment or external service costs
# ==============================================================================

# CURRENT: Comprehensive security scanning
#   - Runs on push to main branch
#   - Runs on pull requests to main branch
#   - Scheduled daily security scans
#   - Zero-cost guarantee maintained
#
# FOR ENTERPRISE: Add advanced security features
#   - Security gate approvals
#   - Compliance reporting
#   - Integration with security tools

    # SECURITY SCANNING STRATEGY - MULTI-LAYER PROTECTION
    # ==========================================================================
    # CURRENT: Zero-cost security validation
    #   - Terraform security scanning (tfsec)
    #   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
    #   - Secret detection and prevention
    #   - Code quality and security analysis
    #
    # FOR ENTERPRISE: Add commercial security tools
    #   - Snyk integration for dependencies
    #   - Checkov for advanced IaC scanning
    #   - SonarQube for code quality
    #   - Custom security policies
    #
    # VALIDATION: Open-source tools only
    # ENTERPRISE: Commercial security ecosystem
